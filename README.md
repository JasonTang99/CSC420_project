# CSC420 Project 

For a more detailed description of the project, please see the [final report](report/report.pdf).

## Summary
This project delves into super-resolution using deep learning techniques, focusing on the application of Delta-STN optimization to the SRResNet architecture. We also evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning on a customized dataset, shedding light on dataset preparation, Delta-STN integration, and neural network implementation.

## Experiments
We preprocess a dataset of Pok√©mon images, employing data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization and generate high-quality results. We explore two key architectures, SRGAN and SRResNet, where we fine-tune pretrained weights and integrate the Delta-STN optimization method.

Through qualitative and quantitative assessments on a series of test images, we showcase our approach's prowess in enhancing image quality and regularizing outputs. We also highlight noteworthy performance enhancements, including improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and perceptual losses.
