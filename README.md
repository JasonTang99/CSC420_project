## Report
Our report can be found in the ```CSC420_report.pdf``` file.

## How to run the code
All of our data, models, and results are available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xfPB6_eGh4wQYLUlZtyAxIcC7WAys1xt?usp=sharing).


To perform training, download the following:
- The ```pokemon.zip``` dataset and extract it into the ```data/``` folder. 
- The pretrained weights (```SRGAN.pt```, ```SRResNet.pt```) for SRGAN/SRResnet and move them into the ```pretrained/``` folder.  

After that, run the ```finetune.ipynb``` notebook, either locally or on Google Colab.
